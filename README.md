# Work Day Scheduler
## A place to log your daily 9-5 schedule with color-coordination related to the time of day. Gray for the past, red for the present and green for the future. After pressing the right save button, the scheduler will keep your information even after the page is refreshed. 

## In the process of making this scheduler I learned how to implement moment.js to create a scheduler that is reactive to the time of day, and utilized local storage to save information users type.

Usage: To use the application, users must type out details into their 9 to 5 schedule, and save the information by pressing the blue save button. After saving, when user's refresh the page, they can continue to reference what information they had written. To clear the scheduler, users can head into the developer tools, then to application, then to local storage where they can select "Ã˜" To delete what information they have stored.
